## **Data Visualization and Analytics Using Python (2 Hours)**

---

### 1. Course Information

* **Course Title:** Data Visualization and Analytics Using Python
* **Duration:** 2 Hours (120 minutes)
* **Target Learners:** Undergraduate / Graduate (Non-Computer Science)
* **Prerequisite:** No programming background required
* **Teaching Mode:** Lecture + Live Demonstration + Mini Projects

---

### 2. Course Description

This short course introduces fundamental concepts of data analytics and data visualization using Python. Learners will explore how to ask meaningful data questions, prepare datasets, create effective visualizations, and interpret insights for decision-making. The course emphasizes practical understanding and hands-on experience rather than advanced programming.

---

### 3. Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. Explain the role of data visualization in data-driven decision making
2. Identify appropriate visualization techniques for different data types
3. Prepare and clean simple datasets for analysis
4. Create basic data visualizations using Python
5. Interpret visualizations and communicate data-driven insights

### 4. Course Schedule (120 Minutes)

### Module 1: The Importance of Data Visualization and Introductory Data Analytics  

This lecture module introduces the foundational role of data visualization in data analytics and emphasizes its function as a cognitive and analytical tool rather than a mere presentation technique. It conceptualizes the transformation from raw data to insight through effective representation and interpretation, situating visualization at the core of exploratory data analysis (EDA). The module integrates theoretical discussion with practical Python-based demonstrations to illustrate how visual methods support hypothesis generation, pattern recognition, and analytical reasoning. Through guided examples and structured self-study exercises, learners develop critical skills in selecting appropriate visualizations, interpreting graphical outputs, and understanding the complementary relationship between visualization and statistical analysis.

### 5. Teaching and Learning Activities

* Short lectures with visual examples
* Live coding demonstrations (step-by-step)
* Guided mini projects (20 minutes each)
* Class discussion and interpretation of results

---

### 6. Assessment (Formative)

* Participation in mini projects
* Completion of visualization tasks
* Insight explanation (verbal or written)

*(No formal examination required for short course)*

---

### 7. Learning Materials

* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
* Sample dataset (CSV format)
* Python libraries (pre-installed):

  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn

---

### 8. Teaching Philosophy

This course focuses on **conceptual understanding and practical literacy** in data visualization. Learners are not expected to master Python syntax but to understand how visual analytics supports reasoning, communication, and decision-making in their respective domains.

---

### 9. Expected Learning Outcome at the End of 2 Hours

Learners will be able to:

> “Look at a dataset, choose an appropriate visualization, and explain what the data is telling us.”
